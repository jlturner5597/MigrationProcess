## Executive Summary

This document outlines the **Surpass Migration Framework** - a comprehensive, structured yet adaptable approach to assessment platform migrations. Built on real-world implementation experience and TOGAF principles, this framework balances the art and science of migration planning to ensure successful outcomes for diverse customer needs.

### Key Framework Components

- **Five-Phase Approach**: A systematic process from pre-sales discovery through go-live and handoff
- **Dependency Reviews**: Critical checkpoints ensuring alignment across all Surpass modules
- **Structured Planning**: Detailed configuration of all platform components with validation at each step
- **Interactive Tools**: Color-coded CLI workflows that reduce cognitive load during implementation
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Thorough testing methodologies to ensure migration success

This framework provides Solutions Engineers with a clear roadmap while maintaining the flexibility to address unique customer requirements. Each phase builds upon the previous one with clear deliverables and transition criteria, ensuring nothing is overlooked in the migration process.
